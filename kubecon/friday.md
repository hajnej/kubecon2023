## Meeting with GKE PM


My questions:

* Managed Prometheus => is it similar as Prometheus Operator? Can I use CR like ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, how about RemoteWrite?
* Anthos Service Mesh => I am aware it is an opinionated distribution of Istio => are there use cases for deploying Kiali/Jaeger etc?
* Any experience with integrating tools like AquaSec Enforcer
* Private cluster endpoint access from another subnets that aren't in VPC / VPC peering
* Default resources requests / limits that are out of boundaries

## [ How to Make Kubernetes Rhyme with Prod-Readiness](https://sched.co/1Hydw)

* Default capabilities of Kubernetes
* What "vanilla" Kubernetes is missing

## [Developing a Mental Model of Istio: From Kubernetes to Sidecars to Ambient](https://sched.co/1HyZj)

* What are differences between Istio and Ambient Service Mesh

## [Crossplane Intro and Deep Dive - the Cloud Native Control Plane Framework](https://sched.co/1HySE)

* Use Terraform to manage resources when you don't plan to use Kubernetes for your workloads and Crossplane when you do!
